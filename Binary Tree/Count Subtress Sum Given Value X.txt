/*
Given a binary tree and an integer X. Your task is to complete the function countSubtreesWithSumX() that returns the count of the number of subtress having total nodeâ€™s data sum equal to the value X.
Example: For the tree given below:            

              5
            /    \
        -10     3
        /    \    /  \
      9     8  -4 7

Subtree with sum 7:
             -10
            /      \
          9        8

and one node 7.

Example 1:

Input:
       5
    /    \
  -10     3
 /   \   /  \
 9   8 -4    7
X = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Subtrees with sum 7 are
[9, 8, -10] and [7] (refer the example
in the problem description).
Example 2:

Input:
    1
  /  \
 2    3
X = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: No subtree has sum equal
to 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countSubtreesWithSumX() which takes the root node and an integer X as inputs and returns the number of subtrees of the given Binary Tree having sum exactly equal to X.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).
